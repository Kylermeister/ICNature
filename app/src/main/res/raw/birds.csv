African Reed Warbler,Acrocephalus baeticatus,Acrocephalidae, The African reed warbler or African marsh warbler (Acrocephalus baeticatus ) is an Old World warbler in the genus Acrocephalus. It breeds in much of Africa south of the Sahara. It is migratory within the continent with southern breeding population moving to the tropics in the southern hemisphere's winter.,This bird is sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the Eurasian reed warbler, Acrocephalus scirpaceus,The African reed warbler or African marsh warbler (Acrocephalus baeticatus ) is an Old World warbler in the genus Acrocephalus. It breeds in much of Africa south of the Sahara. It is migratory within the continent with southern breeding population moving to the tropics in the southern hemisphere's winter. ,This is a common species of marshy areas with reeds sedges or rank vegetation. When not breeding  it may enter gardens.
Egyptian Goose,Alopochen aegyptiacus, Anatidae, The Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca) is a member of the duck goose and swan family Anatidae. It is native to Africa and named for its place of origin. Egyptian geese were considered sacred by the Ancient Egyptians and appeared in much of their artwork. Because of their popularity chiefly as an ornamental bird escapees are common and feral populations have become established in Western Europe the United States, and New Zealand., The Egyptian goose is a large very distinctive waterbird with conspicuous eye patches of dark chocolate-brown. The female resembles the male though is smaller often with darker markings on her beak. The genders can also be told apart by their calls as the male makes a strong hoarse hissing noise while the female produces a harsh trumpeting quack. Young Egyptian geese have a duller color and have a gray tinge on their forewings and their crown and neck are darker with yellowish legs and beak.
Rock Kestrel,Falco rupicolus,Falconidae,The rock kestrel (Falco rupicolus ) is a bird of prey species belonging to the kestrel group of the falcon family Falconidae. It was previously considered a subspecies of the common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus )., This species occurs in Africa from northwestern Angola and southern Democratic Republic of Congo to southern Tanzania and south to South Africa
Cape Turtle Dove,Streptopelia capicola, Columbidae, The ring-necked dove (Streptopelia capicola) also known as the Cape turtle dove or half-collared dove is a widespread and often abundant dove species in East and southern Africa. It is a mostly sedentary bird found in a variety of open habitats. Within range its penetrating and rhythmic three-syllabled crooning is a familiar sound at any time of the year. Its name is derived from the semi-collar of black feathers on the lower nape a feature shared with a number of Streptopelia species. Like all doves they depend on surface water. They congregate in large flocks at waterholes in dry regions to drink and bathe.,Their body feathers are darkest on the upper side where they are coloured in dull tones of grey and brown with shades of lavender on the nape. It is paler below, where a tint of pinkish lavender is usually present. The lower belly and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) is white. As with related species they have white fringes and conspicuous white tips to the otherwise slate grey tail feathers. The tail pattern is particularly noticeable during the display flight.
Steppe eagle,Aquila nipalensis,Accipitridae,The steppe eagle's well-feathered legs illustrate it to be a member of the subfamily Aquilinae also known as the "booted eagles". This species was once considered to be closely related to the sedentary tawny eagle (Aquila rapax) and the two forms have previously been treated as conspecific. They were split based on pronounced differences in morphology and anatomy; two molecular studies each based on a very small number of genes indicate that the species are distinct but disagree over how closely related they are.,It is a specialized predator of ground squirrels on the breeding ground also taking other rather small mammals and other prey doing so more often when ground squirrels are less consistently found. In rather treeless areas of the steppe habitats these eagles tend to nest on a slightly rise often on or near an outcrop but may even the flat wide-open ground in a rather flat nest. They are the only eagle to nest primarily on the ground.
