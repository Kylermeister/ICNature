Glossy Crowberry,Searsia lucida,Anacardiaceae,A versatile shrub or small tree with attractive shiny leaves and creamy white flowers which are followed by green fruits that ripen to red-brown and are relished by birds.,Searsia lucida is a densely branched evergreen shrub 2–3 m tall or occasionally a small tree up to 5 m tall; erect branches can have a spread of up to 4 m. The rough grey to brown bark is slightly fissured. Young reddish brown branchlets are covered in a shiny resin. The wood is red-brown hard tough and durable. Leaves are glossy trifoliate (have three leaflets) with a larger terminal leaflet slightly leathery rather sticky dark olive-green above and below.

wild asparagus,Asparagus aethiopicus,Asparagaceae,A very important species as it is related to Asparagus officinalis which is cultivated as a vegetable crop worldwide. This is a species that adapts very well to a variety of habitats and has the ability to grow well under harsh and disturbed conditions., Asparagus aethiopicus is a branching perennial climber 2–3 m high with firm woody stems which are armed with short 10–12 mm long hard recurved spines. Young stems are twining and ribbed becoming woody smooth and pale. The root system is rhizomatous with many long roots forming bulbous tubers and a mat of fibrous roots from which new stems may resprout. The leaves are not true leaves but are actually leaf-like cladodes (modified flattened stem) which are 10–40 mm long and 1.0–1.5 mm wide and arise in groups of 4–6 from the stem. Cladodes are terete (cylindrical in cross section) or ridged tipped with a short sharp point and usually grey-green.,Asparagus aethiopicus
Hottentots fig,Carpobrotus edulis,Aizoaceae,Carpobrotus edulis is an easy-to-grow succulent groundcover ideal for low-maintenance and water-wise gardens. It is also a useful first-aid plant with edible fruits for the herb or kitchen garden., A robust flat-growing trailing perennial rooting at nodes and forming dense mats. The succulent horizontal stems curve upwards at the growing point. The leaves are succulent crowded along the stem 60-130 x 10-12 mm sharply 3-angled and triangular in cross-section yellowish to grass-green and reddish when older.,Carpobrotus edulis
Tortoise berry,Muraltia spinosa,Polygalaceae,The tortoise berry is a striking plant when covered in its masses of dainty purple flowers. Attractive and unusual spiny foliage pretty red edible fruits and water-wise attributes all combine to make it a great choice for the discerning gardener. A much branched stiffly erect rounded shrub 1 x 1 m with arching spine-tipped stems covered in small, narrow deciduous leaves.Sweetpea-like flowers (purple pink or white) cover the plant in a beautiful mass starting in autumn and continuing through winter to early spring (Apr. to Oct.). The truly lovely flowers superficially resemble those of the pea and legume family but are actually quite different. All members of this genus have three to five sepals and three to five petals. The two lateral sepals are petal-like larger than the others coloured like the petals and resemble the wing petals of a pea flower. The lower 3 petals are fused in a boat-shaped structure and enclose the seven stamens and the style and resemble the keel of a pea flower.,Muraltia spinosa
King Protea,Protea cynaroides,Proteaceae, The best known protea. prized worldwide as a magnificent cut flower and in South Africa honoured as the national flower.,The "flowers" of Protea cynaroides are actually flower heads with a collection of flowers in the centre surrounded by large colourful bracts. The flowerheads vary in size from about 120 mm to 300 mm in diameter. Large vigorous plants produce six to ten flower heads in one season although some exceptional plants can produce up to forty flower heads on one plant. The colour of the bracts varies from a creamy white to a deep crimson but the soft pale pink bracts with a silvery sheen are the most prized.,Protea cynaroides
